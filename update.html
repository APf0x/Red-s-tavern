                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate workflows directly in your GitHub repository. You
                    can use it to build, test, and deploy your projects.</p>

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>To get started with GitHub Actions, you need to create a workflow file named
                    <code>.github/workflows/main.yml</code> in your repository.</p>

                <h2>Creating a Simple Workflow</h2>
                <p>Let's create a simple workflow that runs on every push to the main branch:</p>

                <pre><code class="language-yaml">
            name: Simple Workflow
                    
            on:
              push:
                branches:
                  - main
                    
            jobs:
              build:
                runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                    
                steps:
                  - name: Checkout repository
                    uses: actions/checkout@v2
                    
                  - name: Set up Node.js
                    uses: actions/setup-node@v4
                    with:
                      node-version: '14'
                    
                  - name: Install dependencies
                    run: npm install
                    
                  - name: Build
                    run: npm run build
                </code></pre>
            
                <h2>Understanding the Workflow</h2>
                <p>GitHub Actions workflows are defined in a YAML file, typically located in the <code>.github/workflows</code>
                    directory of your repository. Let's explore the key components of the provided workflow:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> The trigger specifies when the workflow should run. In this case, the workflow is
                        configured to execute on every push event to the main branch. This ensures that changes made to the main
                        branch trigger an automated build and test process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Job:</strong> A job is a unit of work that can run on the same machine or in parallel on different
                        machines. The defined job is named "build" and is set to run on the latest version of the Ubuntu
                        environment. This choice of environment ensures consistency and reproducibility across different workflow
                        runs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Steps:</strong> Steps are the individual tasks that make up a job. Each step is a command or an
                        action that GitHub Actions will run. In this workflow:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The first step, "Checkout repository," uses the <code>actions/checkout</code> action to fetch the
                                latest version of the code from the repository. This is a crucial step as it provides the workflow
                                with the codebase to operate on.</li>
                            <li>The second step, "Set up Node.js," utilizes the <code>actions/setup-node</code> action to set up the
                                Node.js environment. This is essential for JavaScript-based projects.</li>
                            <li>The third step, "Install dependencies," runs the command <code>npm install</code> to install project
                                dependencies. This assumes the presence of a <code>package.json</code> file with defined
                                dependencies.</li>
                            <li>The fourth step, "Build," executes the build script using <code>npm run build</code>. The specifics
                                of the build script depend on your project and may involve tasks like compiling code, running tests,
                                or generating artifacts.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Viewing Workflow Runs</h2>
                <p>The "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository is the central hub for monitoring workflow runs. Once the workflow is
                    triggered, you can navigate to this tab to view a detailed log of each run. The log provides information on
                    every step, including the commands executed and their outcomes. It's a valuable tool for diagnosing issues,
                    verifying successful builds, and understanding the overall workflow performance.</p>
                
                <h2>Expanding the Workflow</h2>
                <p>GitHub Actions offers extensive customization possibilities through the use of actions. Actions are reusable
                    units of code that can be combined to create powerful workflows. The GitHub Actions Marketplace is a repository
                    of community-contributed actions that cover a wide range of tasks. You can explore this marketplace to find
                    actions that suit your project's needs, whether it's deploying to a cloud service, sending notifications, or
                    automating other development tasks.</p>
                <p>Additionally, you can expand your workflow by incorporating features such as conditional execution, matrix builds
                    for testing across multiple environments, and even integrating with third-party services. The flexibility of
                    GitHub Actions empowers you to tailor your automation to the specific requirements of your project.</p>
